# bot-scripts
This repository contains [hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) scripts. I basically started writing these scripts to learn CoffeScript and since this is beginner code and I reinvent the wheel for some of the scripts (for my own understanding), I have not felt the need to contribute this to [hubot-scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts).

## points.coffee
I wrote this for [GeekGazette's](http://gg.ieeeiitr.com/) slack inspired by the '++' used in [SDSLabs'](https://sdslabs.co/) slack. There is already a script with the same functionality, [plusplus.coffee](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/plusplus.coffee), but that for some reason didn't work for us at GeekGazette so I sat down to write a script of my own that did the same thing.
